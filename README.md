9# Tic Tac Toe



## How to play

To play, simply decide on who's going to play as the cross, and who's going to play as the circle.
Tap the box you would like to place your symbol in, and wait for your opponent to choose.

### How to win

To win you must occupy three continuous boxes with your own symbols in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line.
Should neither of you be able to occupy three continuous boxes, the round ends in a tie.

### Statistics

A round ends when a player has won or there has been a tie. In both cases, the result is logged in the statistics page.
